#Netflix EDA project:

#Summarry:
This is a case study done by me to practice and learn the Python libraries **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**.

#Explanation:
In this project, I used a dataset of Netflix shows and movies with multiple columns, including cast, director, genre, etc. Using this data, I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify key insights such as:

- Top countries in movie and TV show production
- Top genres in top countries
- Most frequently appearing cast members in movies
- Top directors in the leading countries
- Best times to add new shows or movies to Netflix

Based on the analysis, I have provided valuable insights and recommendations for Netflix to improve its global business.
