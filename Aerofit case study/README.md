#Aerofit Buyer Analysis Project
##Summary:
This is a case study I completed in which I applird statistical analysis and data visualization using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, along with basic probability concepts.

##Explanation:
In this project, I analyzed a dataset of Aerofit treadmill buyers, which included information such as gender, age, income, product type, and usage patterns. The goal was to uncover insights that could help Aerofit better understand its customer base and improve marketing and sales strategies. Key insights include:

Demographic distribution of buyers across product types

Income groups most likely to purchase specific treadmill models

Gender-wise and age-wise purchase patterns

Probability-based insights to identify the likelihood of a certain type of customer purchasing a particular model

Recommendations for targeted promotions and product positioning based on customer segments

Based on this analysis, I provided actionable insights that can help Aerofit enhance its customer segmentation and improve conversion rates through data-driven decision-making.
